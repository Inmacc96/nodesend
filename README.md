## :rocket: Introduction

The aim of this application is to share files easily and privately with your friends. 

![ReactNodeSend screenshoot](./appImages/reactnodesend.png)

- If you are not logged in, you can upload files up to 1MB. It will generate a link for you, which you share so they can download the file. Once downloaded, the file will be deleted from the server.

- If you are logged in, you can upload files larger than 1MB. You can also protect the download by attaching a password and you can decide after how many downloads the file will be deleted from the server.



## :wrench: Usage

To deploy the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone my repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/Inmacc96/nodesend.git`.
2. Access the backend folder from a terminal and run the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

3. Next, access the frontend folder from another terminal and run the following commands:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn run dev`

Finally, you will have the server at http://localhost:4000 and the client at http://locahost:3000.

### :page_facing_up: Environment variables

It is important to add the _.env_ file in the backend folder with the following content:

```
MONGO_URI = XXXX

JWT_SECRET = XXXX

FRONTEND_URL = http://localhost:3000
```

where

- `MONGO_URI` is the URI of your MongoDB database,
- `JWT_SECRET` is the key to generate and decrypt your JWT.

In addition, you should add the _.env.local_ file in the frontend folder with the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_backendURL =  http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_frontendURL = http://localhost:3000
```

If in doubt, please consult the administrator.
